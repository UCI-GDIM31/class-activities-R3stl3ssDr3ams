### W1
The player is a component of the Cat GameObject, so they will always be allowed to maintain control over its movements,
while the camera is its own GameObject independent from the Cat; so if the Camera were to suddenly be removed from being a 
child of the Cat GameObject, the player would still be able to move the cat, but the camera will remain fixed as it is no longer
attached to the cat's model, and therefore player movement.
